## üìñ Design Decisions

- **Jetpack Compose** was used for faster UI development and a reactive UI model.
- **Clean Architecture** helps separate concerns and makes the codebase more testable and maintainable.
- **Kotlin Coroutines and Flow** was used for background processing and to manage UI state clearly.

---

## üß™ Testing

- Unit tests are written for ViewModel, Respository and UseCases.
- Used Mockito for mocking fakes

## üß† Developer Notes

This project includes inline comments throughout the codebase highlighting:

- ‚úÖ **Design decisions** made during development  
- üß™ **Potential test cases** for both UI and logic layers  
- üîç **Areas for improvement**, optimization, or feature enhancement  
- üß± **Assumptions** made based on current API behavior and UI expectations  
- üßØ **Fallback handling** for edge cases like null data, image load failure, etc.

These comments serve as a roadmap for future development and showcase the architectural thinking behind this implementation.

## ü§ñ Developer Tools & AI Collaboration

To enhance development efficiency and design quality, this project was supported by the following AI tools:

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Used for:
- Code architecture decisions and best practices (Clean Architecture layering)
- Reviewing ViewModel and UseCase logic
- Explaining and debugging Kotlin Coroutines and StateFlow behavior
- Creating unit test strategies and scenarios

### Gemini (via Android Studio)
Assisted with:
- Quick in-editor answers to Android-specific tooling or Gradle issues

### Claude (Anthropic)
Contributed to:
- UI/UX design suggestions
- Structuring a minimal and user-friendly detail screen

> This project came together faster and smoother with a little help from AI tools‚Äîgreat for bouncing off ideas, refining code, and keeping things moving.

## üêû Known Issues & Fixes

1. **Pull-to-refresh indicator doesn't disappear in offline mode**  
   *Cause:* The refresh flow sets the refreshing flag before the network call and resets it to `false` after failure. However, even though the flag is observed as `false` inside the Composable, the indicator remains visible.  
   *Status:* The root cause is unclear. It may be related to Compose recomposition timing or how Material3 `PullToRefreshBox` handles state updates during early failures.  
   *Workaround:* Avoid triggering the refresh flow at all when offline, or force recomposition using an additional flag or key.

2. **Empty screen briefly flashes before cached data loads in offline mode**  
   *Cause:* UI state is momentarily set to empty before the cached data is emitted.  
   *Possible Fix:* Preload cached data into the initial UI state, and only show loading or error states after a short debounce or once fallback loading has completed.

## üß† Improvements

Planned or potential areas for future enhancement:

- [ ] Add pagination for endless scrolling in the news list
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Add support for bookmarks/favorites saved offline
- [ ] Add settings screen (e.g., change category, region, etc.)  
- [ ] Add shimmer placeholders while loading
- [ ] Integrate UI tests using Jetpack Compose testing APIs
